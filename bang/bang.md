## Abstract

This white paper proposes a cosmological model wherein the universe is spatially and temporally infinite, and what we perceive as our "Big Bang" and subsequent expanding universe is a localized energetic release within this infinite expanse. This model posits a cyclical process driven by the inevitable gravitational mergers of massive objects, particularly black holes, in the late stages of localized "heat death." These mergers trigger new, localized expansions – "ripples" in the fabric of spacetime – which manifest as new "universes" in the colloquial sense, each with a finite lifespan of activity and potential for structure formation, including life. Crucially, this model argues that time is not a universal constant but an emergent property tied to the energetic activity within these localized "ripples." This framework allows for the coexistence of numerous such "universes" within the overarching infinite cosmos and suggests a continuous cycle of death and rebirth on a localized scale, driven by fundamental principles of gravity and entropy within an infinite arena. By addressing questions of the initial singularity, the ultimate fate of the universe, and the possibility of existence beyond our cosmic horizon, this model provides a new perspective on the fundamental nature of existence and our place within it.

## 1. Introduction: Beyond the Singular Beginning

The prevailing cosmological model describes our observable universe originating from a hot, dense state approximately 13.8 billion years ago, an event commonly referred to as the Big Bang. While this model successfully explains many observed phenomena, it leaves open questions regarding the initial singularity, the ultimate fate of an expanding universe dominated by dark energy, and the possibility of existence beyond our cosmic horizon. This white paper explores an alternative perspective: that our "Big Bang" is not the singular origin of all existence but rather a significant, yet localized, event within an already infinite and eternal universe.

## 2. The Infinite Arena: Reconceptualizing the "Universe"

We propose that the term "universe," often used to describe our observable cosmos, is a misnomer when considering the true extent of reality. Instead, we posit a single, spatially and temporally infinite Universe (with a capital 'U') that encompasses all of existence. Within this infinite arena, various energetic events occur, leading to localized expansions of spacetime.

## 3. Localized Energetic Releases: The "Big Bangs" Within

What we perceive as our Big Bang is theorized to be one such localized energetic release. The source of this energy could be attributed to a cataclysmic merger of an immense number of massive black holes within a previously quiescent region of the infinite Universe – a region that had undergone its own cycle of activity and eventual "heat death."

## 4. The Role of Black Hole Mergers: Seeds of Renewal

As localized regions of the infinite Universe evolve and approach thermodynamic equilibrium (heat death), matter becomes increasingly concentrated in massive black holes. Due to random motion over infinite timescales and gravitational interactions within sparse remnants, these black holes will inevitably encounter and merge with other massive black holes. These mergers are the most energetic events known in physics, releasing tremendous amounts of energy in the form of gravitational waves. We propose that under certain conditions (potentially involving scales and densities beyond our current understanding), these super-mergers can trigger a localized expansion of spacetime – a new "ripple" in the cosmic "pond."

## 5. "Ripples" of Existence: Finite Lifespans of Local Activity

These newly initiated expansions are what we colloquially refer to as "universes." Each "ripple" undergoes a period of rapid expansion and cooling, allowing for the formation of structures such as galaxies, stars, and potentially life.

## 6. Emergent and Localized Nature of Time

Within the framework of an infinite Universe punctuated by localized energetic releases, the concept of time requires careful consideration. Unlike models that posit a universal, ever-flowing temporal dimension, we propose that time, as a measurable and experientially relevant phenomenon, is an emergent property directly tied to the energetic activity and thermodynamic processes within each localized "ripple" of expansion.
• Energetic Activity and Time: Time emerges from the dynamic processes that occur within these localized "ripples." In regions where energy is concentrated and active, such as during the expansion and cooling phases of a "ripple," time is measurable and experiences its standard progression.
• Quiescent Regions: In the vast regions of the infinite Universe between these active "ripples," where energy density is minimal and matter resides primarily in stable, cold remnants or the gravitational wells of dormant black holes, the conditions necessary for discernible change are largely absent. Without significant motion, interaction, or thermodynamic gradients, there is no inherent "clock" to measure the passage of time. In such quiescent epochs and locations, time, as a quantity we can define or experience, effectively ceases to exist in a meaningful sense. It is not that a universal clock stops, but rather that the very fabric upon which temporal measurement is based – change itself – is largely absent.
• Heat Death and Temporal Boundaries: The "heat death" of a localized "ripple" can be viewed, in part, as a temporal boundary. As energy dissipates and systems approach equilibrium, the rate of change diminishes drastically. For any hypothetical observers within such a region, the experience of time would slow to a crawl and eventually become indistinguishable from stasis. The "nothingness" between energetic releases is not just a spatial void but also a temporal one, devoid of the dynamic processes that define measurable time.
• Rebirth and New Time Frameworks: Each localized "Big Bang" creates not only space and matter but also its own temporal framework, which evolves and eventually fades with the dissipation of energy. Until a new energetic release, triggered by events like super-massive black hole mergers, initiates a new localized epoch of time, the concept of time remains non-existent in these regions.

## 7. Inter-Ripple Remnants and Temporal Discrepancies

A compelling consequence of the cyclical and infinite universe model is the potential for remnants from previous localized energetic releases ("ripples") to persist and eventually interact with newly formed "ripples," such as our own observable universe. Consider a scenario where a prior "ripple" has progressed through its active phase and approached a state of "heat death," with matter largely sequestered in stable remnants like black holes or degenerate stars. During the energetic epochs of this prior "ripple," gravitational interactions, such as galaxy mergers or extreme stellar events, could have ejected massive objects – entire galaxies, star systems, or individual black holes – with velocities sufficient to escape the gravitational confines of their local region as it transitioned towards quiescence.

These ejected remnants would then traverse the vast, low-energy density expanse between expanding "ripples." In these inter-ripple zones, where significant change is minimal, the concept of measurable time, as defined by energetic processes, would be largely absent or proceed at an infinitesimally slow rate relative to the active "ripples."

Eventually, such a remnant could encounter a newly emerging "ripple," like the one that gave rise to our observable universe. The expanding spacetime and gravitational influence of this new "ripple" could "capture" the pre-existing object.

This interaction provides a potential explanation for observed phenomena that appear anomalous within the context of a single Big Bang event. For instance, the Methuselah galaxy (MACS J1149+2223 Lensed Star 1) contains a star whose calculated age has, with some uncertainty, approached or even exceeded the estimated age of our universe based on standard cosmology. If this galaxy and its constituent stars formed and aged within a significantly older or longer-lived "ripple," its encounter with our expanding "ripple" would place an already aged system within a younger temporal context. The internal clock of the Methuselah star, having ticked within a different energetic epoch, would not necessarily align with the timeline defined by our Big Bang event.

Similarly, other seemingly ancient structures or objects detected within our universe might be relics from previous "ripples," carrying with them the temporal history of their origin. Their properties, such as elemental abundances or evolutionary stage, could reflect conditions and timescales vastly different from those prevalent in the early stages of our own "ripple."

This concept of inter-ripple remnants offers a mechanism by which objects with temporal histories independent of our Big Bang can become incorporated into our observable universe, potentially explaining apparent age paradoxes and providing a tangible link to the cyclical nature of the infinite cosmos proposed in this model. The detection and characterization of such remnants could provide crucial insights into the properties and timescales of other localized energetic releases within the vastness of the Universe.

## 8. The Cycle Continues: From Expansion to Quiescence and Rebirth

As each "ripple" expands and the energy density decreases, it eventually trends towards its own localized "heat death." However, the matter and energy are not truly lost but are primarily locked into stable remnants, including black holes. These black holes continue their existence within the infinite Universe, eventually participating in further mergers that can initiate new "ripples" elsewhere or elsewhen. This creates an eternal cycle of localized energetic releases and subsequent periods of activity and quiescence within the infinite cosmos.

## 9. Coexistence of Multiple "Universes": A Vast Cosmic Tapestry

This model naturally allows for the coexistence of an infinite number of such "universes" (localized "ripples") within the overarching infinite Universe. These "universes" would be causally disconnected from one another, each with its own unique history, physical parameters, and stage of evolution.

## 10. Implications for Cosmology and Beyond

- **No Singular Origin:** The universe has no single beginning but is eternally dynamic.
- **Resolution of the Heat Death Paradox:** Localized heat death is not the ultimate end but a transitional phase leading to new energetic releases.
- **Context for Life:** Life arises within the cooling phases of these "ripples," experiencing a finite window of opportunity within each.
- **Multiverse Coexistence:** Provides a framework for the coexistence of numerous "universes" without requiring separate underlying mechanisms.
- **Scale Beyond Current Cosmology:** This model necessitates thinking beyond our observable horizon and considering the implications of infinity.
- **Emergent Time:** Time is not a fundamental constant but an emergent phenomenon tied to energetic activity and thermodynamic processes within each localized "ripple".
- **Explanation for Temporal Anomalies:** Offers a potential explanation for objects appearing older than our universe by considering them as remnants from previous "ripples" with independent temporal histories.

## 11. Future Directions and Challenges

This model, while conceptually compelling, requires further theoretical development and observational support. Key challenges include:

- Identifying a plausible physical mechanism by which super-mergers of black holes can trigger localized expansions of spacetime.
- Developing theoretical frameworks to describe the dynamics of the infinite Universe and the interactions between these localized "ripples."
- Seeking potential observational evidence within our own "universe" that might hint at the existence of other "ripples" or the underlying infinite structure, including the identification of inter-ripple remnants.
- Developing testable predictions related to the localized and emergent nature of time in such a model and the properties of potential inter-ripple remnants.

## 12. Conclusion: An Eternal Dance of Energy and Time in Infinity

The cyclical and infinite universe model presented herein offers a profound shift in our understanding of the cosmos. By positing localized energetic releases as the origin of what we perceive as "universes" within an infinite and eternal arena, it provides a framework for continuous activity, avoids a singular beginning, and offers a context for the finite existence of structures and life within a potentially boundless reality. Crucially, this model positions time as an emergent, localized phenomenon, and introduces the concept of inter-ripple remnants to potentially explain temporal anomalies observed within our "universe." While significant theoretical and observational challenges remain, this perspective opens new avenues for understanding the fundamental nature of existence and our place within the grand, infinite tapestry of the cosmos, where energy and time are forever being re-ignited by the gravitational dance of matter and energy across the infinite expanse. The "heat death" anticipated for our own "ripple" is not an ultimate end but a transition to a state of quiescence, awaiting the potential for future energetic rebirth on a localized scale, and possibly the incorporation of ancient travelers from cosmic epochs long past.
