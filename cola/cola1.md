# Proposal for the "Accurate COLA, Wage Adjustment, and Social Security Stability Act of 2026"

**Purpose:**

To modernize the calculation method for the national inflation index used for Social Security Cost-of-Living Adjustments (COLAs) and referenced in many wage adjustments, ensuring a more accurate and representative measure of annual inflation; and to present options for strengthening the long-term financial stability of the Social Security program in a manner that reflects current economic realities and promotes fairness for all.

**Findings:**

* Current law (42 U.S. Code ยง 415(i)) mandates that the annual Social Security COLA is based on the percentage increase calculated by comparing the **average Consumer Price Index for Urban Wage Earners and Clerical Workers (CPI-W) for the three-month period of the third calendar quarter (July, August, September)** of the current year to the **average CPI-W for the same three-month period (July, August, September) of the previous year**.
* This method was established over 50 years ago, prior to the widespread digital data collection and processing capabilities available today.
* The CPI-W, or closely related CPI indices such as the CPI-U, are fundamental national economic indicators used by the Social Security Administration and frequently referenced or directly incorporated by businesses and in labor agreements to inform or determine cost-of-living adjustments for employee wages.
* Prices captured by the CPI reflect prices paid by consumers, which are influenced by various market factors, including business pricing strategies, sales, and seasonal demand throughout the year.
* Given that business pricing strategies and seasonal demand can influence prices at different times of the year, relying on a comparison of only the third quarter averages of the CPI-W may not fully capture the average inflationary experience across the entire 12-month period relevant to both annual COLA and wage adjustments, potentially misrepresenting the true rise in costs over a full year if price changes are not uniform across all quarters.
* Modern data collection allows for the timely compilation of average CPI figures over a full 12-month period, such as the federal fiscal year (October 1st to September 30th), which immediately precedes the annual COLA announcement in October and aligns with typical wage review cycles.
* A Social Security system designed to maintain the purchasing power of benefits and reflect the economic landscape for both beneficiaries and workers should accurately capture changes in the cost of living. Ensuring the program's long-term financial stability is essential for fulfilling commitments to current and future beneficiaries.

**Provisions:**

This bill proposes to amend 42 U.S. Code ยง 415(i) to revise the calculation of the annual Social Security COLA and presents options for Congress to consider to help ensure the program's financial stability reflects current economic realities.

1.  **Modernized COLA Calculation:** Beginning with COLAs effective in 2027, the Social Security COLA shall be based on the percentage increase in the average Consumer Price Index for Urban Wage Earners and Clerical Workers (CPI-W) for the **12-month period ending on September 30th of the current year**, compared to the average CPI-W for the **12-month period ending on September 30th of the previous year**.
2.  **Encouragement for Wage Adjustments:** The bill encourages employers referencing CPI data for wage adjustments to consider using a similar 12-month measurement period ending in the third quarter (September 30th).
3.  **Options for Ensuring Financial Stability:** To help ensure the long-term financial stability of the Social Security program in conjunction with providing more accurate cost-of-living adjustments, Congress may consider several mechanisms. These options, which do not necessarily require increasing current payroll tax *rates*, could include:
    * **Adjusting the Taxable Maximum:** Gradually adjusting the amount of earnings subject to Social Security payroll taxes such that a higher percentage of total national earnings are subject to the tax than under current law.
    * **Increasing the Federal Minimum Wage:** Raising the federal minimum wage to a level that more closely reflects the actual cost of living in the modern economy. As wages increase, the standard Social Security payroll tax applied to a higher wage base generates additional revenue for the program.
    * **Exploring Other Revenue Sources:** Considering dedicated revenue streams or other adjustments within the existing tax structure that contribute to Social Security's financial health.

**Justification and Benefits:**

* **Improved Accuracy and Economic Fairness:** Shifting the COLA calculation to a full 12-month average provides a more comprehensive and accurate representation of the annual inflation experienced by both Social Security beneficiaries and the general workforce whose wages are tied to CPI data. This ensures income adjustments better reflect the actual rise in the cost of living throughout the year, promoting greater economic fairness.
* **Enhanced Representativeness:** Basing adjustments on a full year of data reduces sensitivity to potential seasonal price variations or short-term fluctuations, providing a more stable and reliable measure of sustained inflationary trends for both benefits and wages.
* **Leveraging Modern Capabilities:** The proposed method fully utilizes current data processing capabilities, modernizing a key economic calculation without introducing delays in the COLA announcement or implementation timeline.
* **Responsible Fiscal Approach:** By outlining mechanisms to ensure the long-term financial stability of the Social Security program without necessarily increasing current payroll tax rates, this bill presents options for addressing potential fiscal considerations in a manner that can be supported by adjusting the tax base or exploring other revenue streams consistent with a fair and robust system, reflecting the principle that incomes keeping pace with costs contributes to the program's revenue base.
* **Comprehensive Solution:** This proposal addresses multiple interconnected issues: the accuracy of the inflation metric, the fairness of income adjustments for beneficiaries and workers, and the financial health of the Social Security program, providing a solid foundation for future system refinements.

**Conclusion:**

The Accurate COLA, Wage Adjustment, and Social Security Stability Act of 2026 offers a comprehensive and fact-based approach to modernizing a critical national economic function. By ensuring that the inflation measure used for Social Security COLAs and wage adjustments is more accurate and representative, and by outlining options for strengthening Social Security's financial foundation in ways that do not necessitate increasing current tax rates, this bill promotes greater economic fairness, enhances the reliability of income adjustments, and supports the stability of the Social Security program for decades to come.
