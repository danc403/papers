# Proposal for the "Accurate COLA and Wage Adjustment Act of 2026"

**Purpose:**

To modernize the calculation method for the national inflation index used to determine Social Security Cost-of-Living Adjustments (COLAs) and referenced in many private and public sector wage adjustments, ensuring a more accurate and representative measure of annual inflation for both beneficiaries and the workforce.

**Findings:**

* Current law (42 U.S. Code ยง 415(i)) mandates that the annual Social Security COLA is based on the percentage increase calculated by comparing the **average Consumer Price Index for Urban Wage Earners and Clerical Workers (CPI-W) for the three-month period of the third calendar quarter (July, August, September)** of the current year to the **average CPI-W for the same three-month period (July, August, September) of the previous year**.
* This method was established over 50 years ago, prior to the widespread digital data collection and processing capabilities available today.
* The CPI-W, or closely related CPI indices such as the CPI-U, are fundamental national economic indicators used by the Social Security Administration and frequently referenced or directly incorporated by businesses and in labor agreements to inform or determine cost-of-living adjustments for employee wages.
* Prices captured by the CPI reflect prices paid by consumers, which are influenced by various market factors, including business pricing strategies, sales, and seasonal demand throughout the year.
* Given that business pricing strategies and seasonal demand can influence prices at different times of the year, relying on a comparison of only the third quarter averages of the CPI-W may not fully capture the average inflationary experience across the entire 12-month period relevant to both annual COLA and wage adjustments, potentially misrepresenting the true rise in costs over a full year if price changes are not uniform across all quarters.
* Modern data collection allows for the timely compilation of average CPI figures over a full 12-month period, such as the federal fiscal year (October 1st to September 30th), which immediately precedes the annual COLA announcement in October and aligns with typical wage review cycles.

**Provisions:**

This bill proposes to amend 42 U.S. Code ยง 415(i) and encourage the use of a more comprehensive inflation measurement period for wage adjustments. Beginning with COLAs effective in 2027, the Social Security COLA shall be based on the percentage increase in the average Consumer Price Index for Urban Wage Earners and Clerical Workers (CPI-W) for the **12-month period ending on September 30th of the current year**, compared to the average CPI-W for the **12-month period ending on September 30th of the previous year**. The bill also encourages employers referencing CPI data for wage adjustments to consider using a similar 12-month measurement period ending in the third quarter (September 30th).

**Justification and Benefits:**

* **Improved Accuracy for All:** Shifting the COLA calculation to a full 12-month average (October-September) provides a more comprehensive and accurate representation of the annual inflation experienced by Social Security beneficiaries over the year immediately preceding their adjustment. Simultaneously, by using this same improved metric, businesses and wage negotiations can rely on a more robust indicator of the past year's inflation when determining pay adjustments for the general workforce.
* **Enhanced Representativeness:** Basing the adjustment on a full year of data reduces sensitivity to potential seasonal price variations or short-term fluctuations that may be concentrated in a single quarter, providing a more stable and reliable measure of sustained inflationary trends.
* **Leveraging Modern Capabilities:** The proposed method fully utilizes current data processing capabilities, modernizing a key economic calculation without introducing delays in the COLA announcement or implementation timeline, as the necessary data for the period ending September 30th is available by the October announcement.
* **Economic Fairness:** Ensuring that both Social Security benefits and wage adjustments are based on a more accurate reflection of annual inflation contributes to greater economic fairness for millions of Americans, helping their income keep pace with the actual rise in the cost of living over the year.

**Conclusion:**

The Accurate COLA and Wage Adjustment Act of 2026 proposes a fact-based modernization of a critical national inflation calculation. By transitioning the COLA to a more representative 12-month average that aligns with the existing timeline and encouraging its use in wage adjustments, this bill aims to improve the accuracy of income adjustments for both Social Security beneficiaries and the broader workforce, promoting greater economic stability and fairness.
